# EDC Documentation

This repository contains the documentation framework for providing the documentation files of all EDC
repositories as a [GitHub page](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

The pages are deployed from the `/docs` sub-directory to <https://eclipse-edc.github.io/docs>.

## Local Deployment

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

cd edc-docs
npm run build
npm run serve
```
